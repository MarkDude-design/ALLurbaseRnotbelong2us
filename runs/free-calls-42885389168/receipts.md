### bs-f2-free-deepseek-r1-r1 (seat: z)

You are helping evaluate answer quality at different compute settings. Answer all four questions in order, each in at most 60 words, no preamble, labeled Q1..Q4.

Q1 arithmetic: A gateway charges $2.00 per million input tokens and $10.00 per million output tokens. A run consumes 3,000 prompt tokens and 4,096 completion tokens, of which 2,800 are hidden reasoning tokens. Give (a) the exact total cost in dollars to six decimals, (b) what percent of the completion spend paid for hidden reasoning, (c) if the same task at a lighter setting needs the same prompt but only 900 completion tokens, the new total cost and the percent saved versus (a).

Q2 inference check: A museum exit survey says visitors who lingered at one overlooked painting reported higher overall satisfaction, so a manager proposes moving that painting to the entrance to raise satisfaction. State the flaw, give one concrete alternative explanation, and name one piece of evidence that would distinguish them.

Q3 compression: Compress the passage below into at most 3 sentences without adding any fact not present. Passage: The bridge was repainted in April 2026 by a crew of eleven. Two suppliers bid and the cheaper bid, from a firm founded in 1998, won. The paint, a polymer blend, cost $40,000. Residents complained the color, chosen by online vote from five options, was too bright; the council noted the vote had 1,204 participants and stood by it. The work finished nine days early.

Q4 judgment: A team must pick one model for a daily low-stakes internal digest: 10,000 input tokens and 2,000 output tokens per day, quality bar is no fabricated facts, latency irrelevant. Candidate prices per million tokens, input then output: A $0.10/$0.50, B $1/$5, C $2/$10, D $10/$50. Which do you pick, give a one-sentence reason, and name one situation where your pick would be the wrong choice.
